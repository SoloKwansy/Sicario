# <strong><em>Sicario</em></strong>

The code for the move prcomputation and generation is absolutely janked. When I first started, it was my first time
coding in C++ and doing an engine so it was done in an absolutely convoluted and confusing way. But... it works... and
works quite well. Plus, the time I absolutely wasted on micro-memory optimization means it uses very little memory for
the move precomputation (at the price of clarity, maintenance, my time and mental sanity), so...

    <li>In some terminal fonts, the name and logo does not render correctly.</li>
    <li>Need to try detect the terminal type and font type ideally.</li>
    <li>Credit the ascii art.</li>
    <li>Pass the move arrays as references. In general, remove pointers where possible and replace with references</li>
    <li>Flush output where necessary.</li>
