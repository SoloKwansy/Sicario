## AI Explanation

The current AI implementation is very vanilla and unfinished and is little better than a beginner. The approach uses a
single-threaded monte carlo tree search with no added features. The eventual intention is to add domain-based knowledge
into some stages of the search to improve the playing strength. It is also a possibility that a neural network could be
used at some stage as well as other AI search features/techniques.
